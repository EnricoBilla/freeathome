Free@Home component for Home Assistant

This is a first start for a component for Free @ Home from Busch-Jaeger.
Now lights, scenes, covers, binary sensors, climate devices and the sensors of the weather station wil show up in Home Assistant. 

Place the files in the custom_components directory. This should be in the same directory as the configuration.yaml.

Put the following in configuration.yaml:
``` 
freeathome:
  host: <ip adress of the sysapserver> or SysAP.local  
  username: <Username in free@home>    
  password: <Password in free@home>    
  use_room_names: <This is optional, if True then combine the device names with the rooms>
```  
Thanks to Foti for testing the cover device!
Thanks to Lasse Magnussen for the climate device!
Thanks to Nadir for testing the weather station

With Home Assistant version 0.88 the way sources should be placed in the custom_components directory has changed. 
This version won't work on earlier versions.
